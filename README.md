# windup_simulator

A static web app that recreates a playful Windows XP-inspired desktop with clickable icons, draggable windows, Start Menu, and a faux taskbar/clock.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. Double-click desktop icons or Start Menu items to launch simulated apps such as My Computer, Internet Explorer, Notepad, and more. Windows can be dragged, minimized, maximized, and focused through taskbar buttons.
